        <TITLE>What is Laugh Loud Creations ...</TITLE>
        <BODY><![CDATA[I love wearing unique pieces created by myself.  Here in my house we love the phrase ‘comfy cozy’. From T-Shirts and sweatshirts to hoodies and joggers, we want to be comfortable.<br><br>I may like this design in that color, a long sleeve or short sleeve, fleece or French terry but the one thing it must be is comfortable. I enjoy testing new products to make sure I pass on amazing quality to my customers. If I sell it, you bet I wear it! My company is <b>Laugh Loud</b>. It is my motto.<br><br>If you are going to laugh, <b>LAUGH LOUD!</b> I love funny, humorous and sarcastic elements in designs. Life is easier when we can laugh at it!<br><br>Personalized clothing are not the only items I love. I enjoy personalizing home décor as well. I love finding unique pieces to customize with your family name. Take a peek and smile ... and most importantly Place an Order!]]>
